# bd-arts.de

This is a project to create my own homepage, [`bd-arts.de`](https://bd-arts.de).
Mainly for the purpose of further education, gaining experience in website development and design, but also as an interesting and fun way to (hopefully) create something great and long-lasting.

The website is intended to fulfil two main tasks: 
1. create a publicly viewable, portfolio-like way to share various types of content.
2. as a homepage for remote access to my home network and the locally hosted services within it.


For the creation of the website, I currently rely on "svelte", a free and open source, component-based JavaScript framework, which I also used for the initial creation of the project. More information can be found at [`svelte.dev`](https://svelte.dev/).


# create-svelte

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npm create svelte@latest

# create a new project in my-app
npm create svelte@latest my-app
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
